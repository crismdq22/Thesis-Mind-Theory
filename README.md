# Thesis-Mind-Theory-Client
Grade thesis for my systems engineering degree, consisting on a Unity player server intended on playing real-life-like routines through a series of human like avatars and environments.
The user can dictate which models to use, where to position them, and a step by step action taken by one of the avatars to display some scene which can denote a situation for the psychologist
patient to observe and empathize to, through animations and audio clips or subtitles on screen. Fully customizable by the user previous to runtime, through client side GUI made in WPF, utilizing 
the included models, animations and audio clips. The system allow for easy inclusion of any other of this kind of assets.

This repo is for the Client GUI only. For the unity player, will upload upon request (due to github not supporting big files like the models).
